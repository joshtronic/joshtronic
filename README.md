# Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Josh

## Husband. Father. Pug dad. Musician.

Iâ€™m Josh Sherman, a product-minded engineer thatâ€™s been developing web
applications since before the turn of the century. Iâ€™ve been fortunate enough to
lead teams for $10MM+ startups and scale systems to tens of millions of users.

Iâ€™m also the founder of [Holiday API][hapi], Head of Engineering at
[Mailshake][ms], and author of the best damn [Lorem Ipsum Library for
PHP][lipsum].

My personal site is a [collection of my writing][words] over the last 16 years
with a heavy focus on technology, development, and occasionally, fermentables.
